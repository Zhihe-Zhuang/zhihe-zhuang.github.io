<h2>About me</h2> 
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p> I was born in February 17th, 1997 in Suqian, Jiangsu Province, China. In June 2019, I received the B.Eng. degree with a major in Automation at the <a href="https://iot.jiangnan.edu.cn/"> School of Internet of Things Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.jiangnan.edu.cn/"> Jiangnan University</a> in Wuxi, China.
</p> 
<p> In September 2019, I began my Ph.D. studies at Jiangnan University under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://iot.jiangnan.edu.cn/info/1141/3532.htm">Hongfeng Tao</a>. My main interests are in the areas of iterative learning control, optimization, and reinforcement learning. I expect to graduate in June of 2025.
